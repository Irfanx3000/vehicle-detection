ðŸš— Vehicle Speed & License Plate Detection

This project detects vehicles in video streams, estimates their speed, and recognizes license plates.
If a vehicle exceeds the configured speed limit, it is logged along with its plate number and images.
Emergency vehicles can also be exempted from overspeeding detection when trained datasets are used.
